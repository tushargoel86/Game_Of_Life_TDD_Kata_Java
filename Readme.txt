Game of Life TDD Kata in Java (In progress)

Problem Description
This Kata is about calculating the next generation of Conwayâ€™s game of life, given any starting position.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life for background.

You start with a two dimensional grid of cells, where each cell is either alive or dead. In this
version of the problem, the grid is finite, and no life can exist off the edges. When calculating
the next generation of the grid, follow these rules:

   1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
   2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
   3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
   4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

You should write a program that can accept an arbitrary grid of cells, and will output a similar
grid showing the next generation.

Clues
The input starting position could be a text file that looks like this:

Generation 1:
4 8
........
....*...
...**...
........
And the output could look like this:

Generation 2:
4 8
........
...**...
...**...
........


Test cases:
1. Game should take grid size and live cell(s) as an input
2. In case of 1 alive cell, all cells will be dead
3. In case of neighbours less than 2, all cells will be dead
4. In case of neighbours more than 3, all cells will be dead
5. Any dead cell with 3 live neighbours got its life
6. Initial input should decide whether cell needs to be died or alive
7. Cell present in the boundaries should be died

LifeDecision Rules:

1. Each cell has 8 neighbours in all direction
2. In case of less than 2 alive neighbours cells for any cell that cell will be died
3. In case of more than 3 alive neighbours cells for any cell that cell will be died
4. Any dead cell with 3 live neighbours got its life
